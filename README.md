# Week-Time-Calculator-V1
This is a small tool I made to uhhhh, support my school reading log homework.
If you enter an impossible amount of minutes and hours, it obvi won't work, I'm considering adding a failsafe for an excessive amount of time, but not for now.

Instructions (Mac):
(You must have Python 3 installed)
Run the following commands:
git clone https://github.com/Eobam/Week-Time-Calculator-V1.git
cd Week-Time-Calculator-V1
python main.py
